<p align="center"><strong>technology for cooperation</strong></p>

---

We're building a cooperation platform — identity, governance, and investment infrastructure that lets strangers collaborate on complex, long-horizon endeavors with the same trust they'd extend to a neighbor.

### Open Source

- **[template](https://github.com/inixiative/template)** *(in progress)* — Reusable SaaS monorepo foundation. Bun, Hono, Prisma 7, React/TanStack, BullMQ, Redis — auth, permissions, jobs, and multi-tenant patterns out of the box.
- **[json-rules](https://github.com/inixiative/json-rules)** — Type-safe rules engine with 38 operators. Declarative business logic for permissions, pricing, eligibility, and form visibility.
- **[hivemind](https://github.com/inixiative/hivemind)** — Multi-agent coordination library. Message bus with role-scoped channels for AI-powered workflows.
- **[whitepaper](https://github.com/inixiative/whitepaper)** *(in progress)* — Adaptive governance infrastructure for cooperative societies.

### Coming Soon

- **rules-builder** — Visual rule builder UI for json-rules. Drag-and-drop condition authoring.
- **inixiative platform** — Identity, permissions, escrow, and governance. The shared infrastructure layer for cooperation at scale.
